language: cpp bc fastest

ide: doesn't matter as long as we can commit and push

input notes:
no edges from vertex to itself
can have forests

edge cases (check if these are legal): 
single vertex by itself, legal
cycle with two vertices (e.g. 1 is a prereq for 2, 2 is a prereq for 1), legal
connected component with 1 edge and 2 nodes (is this a good one?)
